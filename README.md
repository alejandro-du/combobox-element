# ComboBoxElement Add-on for Vaadin

This is an experimental Vaadin add-on that encapsulates a [vaadin-combo-box](https://vaadin.com/elements/-/element/vaadin-combo-box) HTML element in a Vaadin component.

Currently, this add-on is intended to serve as an example of the [Elements add-on](https://vaadin.com/directory#!addon/elements-add-on). It probably makes no sense to use this add-on instead of the ComboBox component from the core, but I hope it inspires you to wrap other Web Components with a plain Java API!
